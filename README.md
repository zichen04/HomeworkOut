# HomeworkOut
fun little personal project to learn and mess around with openCV

The idea of is this is to make a program which interrupts me every 10 minutes when i'm doing homework, and freezes my mouse and input.
Input will not be unfrozen until I do 10 push ups, so i will use my webcam and openCV to track my body movement, using the change in movement it will count the push ups and un-freeze my mouse and keyboard input when 10 push ups is acheived
