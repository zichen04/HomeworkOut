# HomeworkOut
fun little personal project to learn and mess around with openCV

Rough idea as of 9/20/2024

Been lacking in the exercise department lately, the idea of is this is to make a program which interrupts me every 10 minutes when i'm doing homework and forces me to do some push ups

Every 10 minutes my mouse and keyboard inputs will be frozen. Using my webcam and openCV, the program will detect and count push ups. Once I reach 10, my mouse and keyboard will be unfrozen.
